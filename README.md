## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) – Utility-first framework for styling
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Grid and Flexbox layout

---

### What I Learned

This project helped me sharpen my Tailwind utility class usage and understand how to:

- Apply responsive grid layouts using `grid-cols-3` on medium screens and above
- Use custom fonts like **Lexend Deca** and **Big Shoulders Display**
- Style interactive buttons with Tailwind's hover and ring utilities
- Build consistent component cards with utility classes

Example button styling I liked:

```html
<button class="px-6 py-3 rounded-full bg-white text-primary-orange hover:bg-transparent hover:text-white hover:ring-2 hover:ring-white">
  Learn More
</button>
```

---

### Continued Development

Next, I want to focus on:

- Improving accessibility (ARIA labels, better focus handling)
- Using Tailwind's `@layer` to organize styles
- Building reusable card components across projects

---

### Useful Resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) – Great reference while building
- [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org/) – Helpful for embedding Google fonts locally (for future projects)
- [Frontend Mentor Slack Community](https://frontendmentor.io/slack) – Great for feedback and support
